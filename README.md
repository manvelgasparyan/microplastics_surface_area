This project involves the development of a MATLAB implementation for converting micro- and nanoplastics concentrations from particle counts (particles/mL or particles/gram) to mass units (grams/mL or grams/gram), as well as calculating the total surface area using a specific method. The goal is to provide an accurate and efficient solution for this type of conversion.

The current Matlab library is applicable to cases with these three possible shapes of micro- and nanoplastics :

Case 1: Sphere

Case 2: Pseudosphere

Case 3: Cylinder
